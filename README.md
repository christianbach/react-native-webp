react-native-webp adds support for WebP images for react-native components.

# Installation

1. ```npm install https://github.com/dbasedow/react-native-webp.git --save```
2. ```rnpm link``` (or manually add module to your project)
3. Open your project in xcode
4. Right click your project root and select "Add Files to ..."
5. Select "WebP.framework" from node_modules/react-native-webp/ and click "OK"
6. Select your Target
7. Select "Build Settings"
8. Add "$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-webp" to the "Framework Search Path"

# Usage
You don't have to do anything other than use WebP images. This project adds a custom RCTImageDataDecoder to your project, so all react-native components should be able to use WebP files. If you are using custom components that work with UIImages directly (without using RCTImageDataDecoder) you will have to change that code.
